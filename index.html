          <h3>Cairo: A Timeless Journey Through Islamic History</h3>
          <p>
            Step into the heart of Islamic Cairo, where every stone whispers
            tales of a glorious past. Wander through labyrinthine alleys adorned
            with majestic mosques, grand madrasas, and ancient souqs that have
            stood for centuries. Marvel at the towering minarets of Al-Azhar,
            the world’s oldest university, or lose yourself in the intricate
            designs of Sultan Hassan Mosque, a masterpiece of Mamluk
            architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, history isn’t just remembered—it’s alive. The scent of spices
            fills the air, the call to prayer echoes through time, and the
            warmth of its people makes you feel at home. Cairo isn’t just a
            city; it’s a living museum of faith, art, and resilience. Come, walk
            where legends once tread, and let Cairo’s Islamic soul inspire you.

                Al-Azhar Mosque is the world's oldest Islamic university,
                established by the Fatimids in 970 CE as a center for Shiite

                of Sunni scholarship after the fall of the Fatimid dynasty. The
                complex showcases unique architecture blending Fatimid, Mamluk,
                and Ottoman styles, featuring three minarets (the most famous
                being Qaytbay's Minaret) and the Turkish Portico built by Abd
                al-Rahman Katkhuda. It maintains significant religious and
                political influence in Egypt and the Muslim world, housing
                Al-Azhar's curriculum and serving as a religious authority for
                millions of Muslims. Symbolizing the harmony between heritage
                and modernity, it attracts visitors with its vast library
                (containing rare manuscripts) and spacious gardens, while
                maintaining its role as a beacon of knowledge for over a
                millennium.
